## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve fmpm` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build fmpm` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

# FMPM Microservices

This repository contains a set of microservices built using the NX workspace. The project consists of the following services:

- `fmpm-integration-rate`: Handles rate integration.
- `fmpm-auth`: Manages authentication.
- `fmpm-transaction-order`: Manages transaction orders.
- `fmpm-wallet`: Manages wallet operations.
- `fmpm-gateway`: The gateway service that routes requests to the appropriate microservice.

## Architecture

This project follows a microservice architecture using NX workspace to manage multiple services efficiently.

- **NX Workspace**: A powerful build framework for managing multiple projects in a single repository.
- **Microservices**: Each service is independent and can be deployed, scaled, and developed independently.

### Services

1. **fmpm-integration-rate**:

   - Provides currency rate integration services.
   - gRPC-based service for high performance.

2. **fmpm-auth\*\***:

   - Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - Uses JWT for secure authentication.

3. **fmpm-transaction-order**:

   - Manages and processes transaction orders.
   - Ensures data integrity and handles business logic for transactions.

4. **fmpm-wallet**:

   - Manages user wallets, including balance inquiries and transactions.
   - Ensures secure and efficient wallet operations.

5. **fmpm-gateway**:
   - Acts as the API gateway, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
   - Ensures a single entry point for all client requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker installed (optional, for containerized deployment)
- NX CLI installed globally

```sh
npm install -g nx
```

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fmpm-microservices.git
cd fmpm-microservices
npm install
```

Running the Services
Each service can be run individually or all together using NX commands.

Running Individual Services
Navigate to the service directory and start the service:

```sh
Copy code
nx serve fmpm-integration-rate
nx serve fmpm-auth
nx serve fmpm-transaction-order
nx serve fmpm-wallet
nx serve fmpm-gateway
```

## Running All Services

To run all services simultaneously, you can use the NX run-many command:

```sh
nx run-many --target=serve --all
```

## Usage

API Endpoints
fmpm-integration-rate
GET /rate: Fetch current rates.
fmpm-auth
POST /auth/login: User login.
POST /auth/register: User registration.
fmpm-transaction-order
POST /transaction/create: Create a new transaction.
GET /transaction/:id: Get transaction details.
fmpm-wallet
GET /wallet/balance: Get wallet balance.
POST /wallet/transfer: Transfer funds.
fmpm-gateway
Acts as a proxy to the other services.

## Environment Variables

Each service uses environment variables for configuration. Refer to the .env.example file in each service directory and create a .env file with the required values.
